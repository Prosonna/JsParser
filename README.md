# JsParser
While working in the Sanofi project I made a program which was helpful to the entire team. Initially, our plan was to write automation codes in protractor; so we maintained the protractor format to write all the test-cases. Later, our Project Manager told us that our onshore team wanted to view our test-cases but those were not understandable to them. It was quite impossible to write them in the excel format again. Hence, I wrote a program using regular expressions that could tokenize the codes from the JS files, keep the required portion and convert them into excel files using proper formatting. Then, I converted 85 JS files to excel files using my program.

How to Operate: 

Change the JS file name and location as required, then run the program.
A .csv file "Output.csv" will be created in the given location.
